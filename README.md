### Reactor Planner Project

The Reactor Planner Project is a open source recreation of the IC2Classic Reactor API implementation.
The idea being that a standalone App can be used to simulate/share reactor setups.

This implementation isn't a copy of the in mod implementation but an aproximation and may differ from the original.
